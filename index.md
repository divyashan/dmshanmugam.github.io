## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.png">

I'm a Ph.D. student at MIT in the [Clinical and Applied Machine Learning Group](ddig.mit.edu). I work on building machine learning models that are resilient to unreliable data. This [interest map](pdfs/interest_map.pdf) summarizes questions I care about.

I went to MIT for undergrad and majored in computer science with a concentration in South Asian studies. I'm also a former intern at Microsoft Research (x2), Borealis AI, D.E. Shaw Research, Counsyl and Aetion. You can find my CV [here](pdfs/cv_11_19_2021.pdf) or email me at divyas at mit dot edu, or both! 

## Research Interests

I'm interested in how we can deploy and develop machine learning models in the presence of unreliable data. I like to start with a specific clinical application and develop general-purpose machine learning techniques. I'm especially interested in **applications in women's health**, including ovulatory disorders and intimate partner violence, and techniques to address the **noisy labels** common to these settings.
